# 📊 Stats-Unraveled: R Explorations in Probability & Inference

This repository captures my hands-on journey through key concepts in probability and statistics using R, developed as part of my graduate coursework at Northeastern University. Each module is a practical application of theory—modeled through simulation, visualization, and inference.

## 📁 Project Modules

### 🎲 Module 1: Toss the Odds – Simulating Random Events
- **File**: `random_event_simulations.R`
- **Topics**: Bernoulli trials, coin tosses, dice rolls, relative frequencies  
- **Objective**: Understand randomness through repeated simulation and the Law of Large Numbers.

### 📦 Module 2: Stack the Probabilities – Discrete Distributions in Action
- **File**: `discrete_distributions.R`
- **Topics**: Probability mass functions, expected value, skewness, variance  
- **Objective**: Explore how different discrete distributions behave using descriptive stats and visualizations.

### 🧮 Module 3: Curve It Like Gauss – Normal Distribution & CLT
- **File**: `normal_distribution_explored.R`
- **Topics**: Central Limit Theorem, normal distribution, Z-scores, bell curves  
- **Objective**: Visualize and understand properties of the normal distribution and how it emerges from sampling.
